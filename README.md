* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.
* ``InsureBook`` is a simple GUI application with CLI-based user interactions, that allows insurance agents to easily keep track of potential and existing clients, their policies, and scheduled appointment dates. <br>
  Example usages:
  * as a tracking tool for insurance agents to manage their clients and appointments.
  * as a reminders tool for insurance agents to keep track of their appointments. <br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _InsureBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[InsureBook Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
